      <em>I actually just kinda like pandas. Like, it's just a casual thing. 
      We're not super serious or anything at this point. IDK, we'll see
      where things go. I mean, I'm not really over elephants yet. 
      I still have pretty strong feelings about elephants. And Pitbulls,
      obvi. Maybe I just have too much love to give to only one animal species?
      I'm young. Don't pressure me, pls and ty.</em>
